(Work in progress)

Description: The CarAPI is a full stack application to allow for the querying of cars based on multiple criteria: make, model, trim. 
 - Currently adding support for searching cars by year, mileage, and price.

Tech stack:
1. Spring Boot (Java) for the Backend
2. Angular (TypeScript) SPA Frontend
3. JUnit and Selenium Webdriver with Cucumber for automated testing
